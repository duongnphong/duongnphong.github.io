I am a student at [Graduate School of Science and Technology](https://www.kit.ac.jp/en/academic-programs/graduate-school/), Kyoto Institute of Technology. 

My research focuses on medical image processing. Specifically, I am working on `transforming` and `extracting` meaningful information from `3D mesh` and `point cloud data` to make it compatible with machine learning models. The ultimate goal of my work is to enhance diagnostic accuracy and optimize treatment strategies in the medical field.

In the midst of studying `Image Processing`, `Computer Vision` and `Japanese`.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
